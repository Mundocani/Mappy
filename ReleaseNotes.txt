3.6 Changes

FEATURE: Restored flashing and large node features. A huge thanks to Voxxel for the legwork in finding the solution. Blizzard's new blip textures have more room for nodes, so I've been the large size bigger. Unfortunately the flashing is causing the minimap blips to flicker terribly, so I've reduced the flash rate to minimize that. I suggest keeping the flashing mode turned off unless you're gathering.

-----------------------------------------------------
New in 2.0

- Save and load different minimap configs (size, position, transparancy, etc.)
- Automatic button stacking can now be disabled
- Minimap can be 'ghosted' so that clicks pass through it

Here are the new commands:

/mappy ghost Makes clicks on the minimap pass through to whatever is behind it
/mappy unghost Makes clicks on the minimap work like normal

/mappy default Loads your normal Mappy size, position, transparancy, etc.
/mappy save mysettingsname Saves the current minimap configuration under the name mysettingsname
/mappy load mysettingsname Restores the saved configuration named mysettingsname

I've included one built-in set which gatherers may find useful (I know I do). Try this:

/mappy load gather

and you will get a large, completely transparant minimap centered on your screen with clicks set to pass through it.  What this does is gives you just the yellow node dots in a HUD which makes cruising around looking for mats pretty nice.

- Saved minimap configs can be loaded by using their name as a command. For example '/mappy raid' will load a saved configuration named raid (previous versions required the longer '/mappy load raid' to do the same thing)
